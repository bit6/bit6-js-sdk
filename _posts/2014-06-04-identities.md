A user can have multiple identities - username, email, facebook, google, phone number etc. Identities are required for the user authentication, working with contacts, identifying user's network. An identity is represented by a URI.

### Username

A username should only include alphanumeric characters. Case insensitive. Examples

```
usr:john
usr:test123
```

Only username identities are suppored for Beta 1 and 2. Support for other identities will be added later.
